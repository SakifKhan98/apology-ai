	_A global apology counter for the world's most beloved (and possibly most tormented) Dr. Chowd._
</div>

## What is this?

Have you ever wronged Dr. Chowd? (Of course you have.)

This is a gloriously unnecessary web app where you can join the masses in saying "SORRY" to Dr. Chowd for all the things you've said, done, or will inevitably do. Every click is a digital hug. Or a digital slap, but with remorse.

## How does it work?

1. Go to the site.
2. Click the **I‚Äôm Sorry** button.
3. Watch the global apology count go up. (Yes, it‚Äôs real. Yes, it‚Äôs public. Yes, Dr. Chowd is watching.)
4. Repeat as needed. (Therapy not included.)

## Tech Stack

- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Because we‚Äôre not animals.
- **Supabase**: For storing all those heartfelt (and not-so-heartfelt) apologies.
- **Netlify Functions**: Because someone has to count your sins.

## Why?

Because Dr. Chowd deserves better. And because saying sorry is easier when you can do it anonymously on the internet.

## Can I contribute?

Sure! Fork it, clone it, and add your own flavor of remorse. Or just click the button a thousand times. We‚Äôre not judging (but Dr. Chowd might be).

## To Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/SakifKhan98/apology-ai.git
$ cd apology-ai

# Open index.html in your browser
```

Or just visit the live site and start apologizing. (You know you need to.)

## License

MIT. Because forgiveness should be free.
